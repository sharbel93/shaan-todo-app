   <!-- adding TodoListItemComponent to the template already allows us to explore what API the TodoListItemComponent should offer. 
    This makes it easier for us to write the TodoListItemComponent in the next section because we now know what input and outputs we would expect TodoListItemComponent to have. -->
   
    <!-- We pass in the todo item through the todo property using the [todo] input property syntax and attach event handlers to the events we would expect the TodoListItemComponent to emit,
       such as the toggleComplete event and the remove event. -->
