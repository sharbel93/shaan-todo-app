smart and dumb components. 
Decoupling the TodoListHeaderComponent from the TodoDataService makes the TodoListHeaderComponent a dumb component.
A dumb component is not aware of what happens outside of itself. 
It only receives input via property bindings and only emits output data as events.

Using smart and dumb components is a good practice. 
It greatly improves separation of concerns, making your application easier to understand and maintain. 
If your database or back-end API changes, you donâ€™t have to worry about your dumb components. 
It also makes your dumb components more flexible, allowing you to reuse them more easily in different situations. 
If your application needs the same component twice, where one time it needs to write to a back-end database and another time it needs to write to an in-memory database, a dumb component allows you to accomplish exactly that.

The TodoListHeaderComponent is a dumb component and the AppComponent remains responsible for storing the todo using the TodoDataService.
